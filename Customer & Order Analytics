SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS JanRevenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum) AS customers, AVG(Quantity*price) AS AvgSpent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
